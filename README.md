###### COMP 131: Artificial Intelligence
###### Homework 4: Genetic Algorithms -- Knapsack Problem

### Code Details

### IMPLEMENTATION
  This is our implementation of the knapsack problem using a Genetic Algorithm
  as described by the specification on canvas.

  * The knapsack problem simulates the placement of items in a knapsack.
  * Each knapsack item has the following properties:
    * a weight attribute value,
    * and an importance attribute value.

###ARCHITECTURE
  This implementation uses genetic algorithms as an optimization to return the ideal combination of items in the backpack with
  the total weight not exceeding the maximum capacity of 120, and the total
  value of items in the backpack being as large as possible.
